### CPSC 120 

*Lab 2
In Lab 2, part 2 is one of my favorite labs I did. It is one of my favorite labs because I was curious how to put a quadratic formula in a program. Also, I learned there can be two solutions to finding the problem using the quadratic formula.

*Lab 3
In Lab 3, part 1 is also one of my favorite labs I did. It is one of my favorite labs because I was curious and curious how to make a sandwich by creating a code and programming it. I learned my coding is mostly filled with std::cout or std::cin.

*Lab 7
Lastly, Lab 7, is one of my favorite labs I did. It is my favorite lab because I was curious and didnâ€™t know about date differences and how to create a program with it. I learned how to find how many days there are from 2022 and 2000.
